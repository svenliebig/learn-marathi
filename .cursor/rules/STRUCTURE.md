# Structure

This file contains rules for the structure of the code and the project.

## Files

### Naming

- Use lowercase letters for file names
- Use hyphens to separate words in file names
- Use PascalCase for component names
- Use kebab-case for folder names

### Components

Components should be in the `components` folder.

## Code

- Use `function` to declare react components instead of `const`
- Create types for component props
